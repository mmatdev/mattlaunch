# mattlaunch
Welcome to the mattlaunch [ml] OPEN SOURCE extension page! This extension makes it so you don't have to remember any of my usernames for any website because I do change them a lot, lol.

## Why Use It?
Why not!

## Want to help?
Do a pull request!

## Anything is broken?
Open an Issue! or if you know how to fix it, look above this!

## Conclusion
In conclusion, you can use this project to create your own mattlaunch esc extesnsion or download it earlier than when the stores release it.

## Why download it from GitLab / GitHub
You get all the changes EARLIER! Just compile the extension yourself by compressing it into a ZIP file, using developer mode, and loading in an unpackaged source! (or something along those lines)
